Course Description
In-store and online fashion shop experience depend on many factors such as prices, products and the shop environment. Customer service is key to how clients perceive a fashion store. Although fashion businesses have no control over their competitors, they can control customer service levels.Therefore, businesses that sell clothes and related accessories (or any other retail business) should always strive to improve their level of customer service. The kind of support a fashion shop accords its customers can either improve or reduce their shopping experience. Generally, that also explains the essence of customer service in retail at large.This course is divided into four short modules to help you understand customer service, whether you want to open a fashion shop or work in support.
