Course Description
Terrorism is a real and looming threat, and its devastating effects have been experienced time and time again. One of the major tools that terrorist groups use to promote their propaganda and garner support, is the radicalisation of youths and students from a young age. They try to increase their numbers through constant contact, communication and brainwashing of young minds. While most children are not attracted to such groups or activities, some may be at higher risk of radicalisation. The Prevent Duty recommendations seek to protect young people from the effects of extremism by promoting inclusivity and encouraging positive debate and discussion.

How terrorist groups use radicalisation of youths to achieve their social, economic and religious ideologies

How teachers and school staff can assess risks and observe signs of worrying behaviour 
What teachers and school staff are expected to do in the event that they notice any cause for concern 
The CIN provision and how to deal with the situation if a child or group is discovered to be vulnerable to radicalisation
