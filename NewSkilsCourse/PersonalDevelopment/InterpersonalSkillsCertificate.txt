Course Description
Interpersonal skills are social skills that allow you to interact and communicate with people around you. They shape who we are and how others view us in our daily lives. These abilities are learned from the experiences you have had throughout life. While this skill set can come easily to many people, some people find it more difficult socialising in the workplace, home and elsewhere. As we are all a product of our environment, everyone is different in how they learned to socialise with others. Finding ways in which to better ourselves is and always has been attainable.In this course, we are going to discuss the importance that these skills play in leading a successful and fulfilling life. You are going to discover that there are ways in which to train yourself to use your learned behaviours, to enrich and enhance any situation in which you may find yourself. The result is a more confident version of yourself that can assess and overcome problems and issues. It takes time, but the beauty of interpersonal skills is that they can always be taught and relearned when needed. Working on these behaviours daily can lead to a more rewarding life and career.
