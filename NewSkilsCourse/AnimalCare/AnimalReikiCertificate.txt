Course Description
(Course taken from Newskills Academy USA Library)Animal Reiki is a healing technique. Dating back to thousands of years ago, Reiki uses positive divine energy to heal animals. It has the same effect on both humans and animals. The symbols, principles and intent of the healing practice does not depend on any belief systems. It draws positive energy for the benefit of both the giver and recipient of positive healing energy.Anyone can join Reiki classes to take up a career in the therapy, or use it to heal their pets whenever they feel unbalanced for better well-being. You can practice Reiki and become an expert in providing Reiki energy healing. With proper training, you can be licensed and certified as a Reiki healer. Animals, just like humans, are receptive to divine healing.Animals understand the treatment, because they can also transfer the healing energy to their owners. This course covers Animal Reiki in four basic modules for beginners in practicing this healing technique.
