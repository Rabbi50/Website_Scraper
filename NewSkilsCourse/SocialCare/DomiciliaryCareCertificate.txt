Course Description
Learning about domiciliary care is essential for anybody who either requires care for themselves or a loved one or would like to provide a domiciliary care service as an individual or an agency. Domiciliary care is an increasingly popular alternative to care homes, but there is a lot of contradictory information out there, and this course will provide you with a concise and accurate guide. We cover the basics of who requires domiciliary care, the various tasks and responsibilities involved and the fundamental standards that must be adhered to. You will also be taken through a step-by-step guide on how to apply for council-assisted domiciliary care and how to source it privately via agencies and trained individuals. Finally, we provide a complete guide on how to register as a domiciliary carer, either individually or as an agency, and take you through the mandatory legislative and practical steps to provide this service legally in the UK.
