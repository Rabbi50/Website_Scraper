Course Description
Taking this fast track course will be beneficial if you are looking to become an IT professional or considering a career switch. But even if you don’t want to work as a coder, taking this course would expand your technical knowledge and confidence and give you a new perspective on the technological changes in the world. Anyone can learn to code!The course contains the essential concepts that anyone who is new to coding should learn in order to start writing simple code. This course is designed with the beginner in mind and packed full of example code in Python - one of the most popular general purpose coding languages in the last couple of years.By the end of the course, you will also know a lot about object-oriented programming, and learning these fundamental principles will not only give you a background for further study, but will show you another way to think about the world from a machine’s point of view.The aim of the course is to help you write and run your first lines of actual code. It is a practical course with fun coding activities and exercises as well as all the needed material to guide you in completing them.There are a number of benefits to taking this course, which include:


The history of coding including all notable achievements and computer prototypes
The main components of a computing machine for storing digital information in binary
How to create variables, set their data types and use operators for complex calculations
Controlling the flow of the program by writing conditional statements for recursion
How to use built-in functions and write your own self-contained code
How to organise your code in modules and packages that can reference each other
The ideas behind Object-Oriented coding
How to construct programs using structures such as classes and instances



A comprehensive, practical and easy-to-understand course material
Example code with comprehensive explanations using the Python coding language
End of module activities and a final test which are designed to expand your overall understanding and put what you’ve learned into action
Can be completed anywhere with an Internet connection
Gaining relevant knowledge about an ever-growing industry, which will provide you with practical skills for the workforce
Being able to write simple Python programs at the end of the course
