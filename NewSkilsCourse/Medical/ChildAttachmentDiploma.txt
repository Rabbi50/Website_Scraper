You will be taught the signs to look out for when there are any issues in this field and there are tests that can be implemented along the way to better facilitate this. By the end of the course, you should be able to apply the guiding principles of child attachment theory with relative ease.From working as a social worker, to a child psychologist and even a classroom assistant, this course will prove to you that there is such a huge variety of roles connected with the field of child attachment.
