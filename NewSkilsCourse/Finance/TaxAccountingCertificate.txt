The Tax Accounting course aims to improve your understanding of the way tax and accounting systems in the UK work which would be particularly useful to small business owners, entrepreneurs, employed people and anyone looking to improve their general knowledge on the wide subject of tax. The course is split into ten different topics sorted in a logical progression from fundamental knowledge of the various taxes applicable to companies and individuals in the UK, to the advanced accounting methods and financial analysis techniques.In order to define the complex tax terms, we have used real-life examples throughout the course that illustrate each tax concept and give you a practical perspective on the theory that the course covers. Furthermore, you can check what you have learned with a carefully prepared test.In this course, you will be able to learn about Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and gain a unique overview of taxation laws and rules in the UK. Employment is another area that the course covers as it outlines the rights and responsibilities both for employers and employees with regards to tax.There are numerous benefits and allowances as part of the UKâ€™s welfare system that is funded by the taxpayers in the UK and comes from National Insurance contributions and Income tax, the two primary methods of taxing individuals. People in hardship as well as individuals who perform special duties can benefit greatly from claiming such allowances to help them make ends meet.However, the primary focus of this course is taxation from a business point of view, making it a great piece of reference for just about any business owner or entrepreneur. Tax responsibilities as well as the most important dates and deadlines have been noted down and instructions on registration and payment have also been included, making sure you have all the knowledge to successfully manage company tax returns, corporation tax and claim business reliefs that can help your business.The course outlines the PAYE scheme in detail and explores what it is like to run a payroll, choose payroll software, produce payrolls for your employees and make the appropriate deductions.One of the most common business taxes in the world and in the UK is the Value-Added Tax or VAT. This course is your primary detailed guide to the various rates of VAT, when to charge them and how to claim back VAT that has been charged on your own purchases. Further, it explores the rules, regulations and taxes for trading internationally as well as exporting and importing to and from the UK.The last sections of the course aim to teach you practical accounting, starting from defining the basic accounting concepts for beginners and taking it further to how to prepare financial reports, calculate various financial ratios and analyse how successful the business is performing.Finally, there are a number of international standards when it comes to taxation and accounting reporting and the course provides an overview of how the existing tax standards came into being and which international and British organisations enforce these regulations. Keeping up with the recent news, it also outlines the possible impact that the upcoming exit from the European Union may have on taxation in the UK.
